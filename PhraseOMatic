/* *** New Project ***
/* Goal: Take String input from user and use that input to produce a deliberate output of buzzwords, non-offensive insults, etc.
/* Details: 1. You must make a TESTER or CLIENT class that will make objects of the class PhraseOMatic and call the method makePhrase.
/* 2. the Tester class must take user input
/* 3. you must make another method of makePhrase to overload it with parameters from given from the String characters of user input
/* see this URL for an example of a successful implementation
